Advent of Code 2022 Python Solutions

Day 1 and already behind.

Day 2 and 3 up.  Code is super messy.

Day 4 more sets, abuse memory and look at intersections and differences

Day 5 more Sets,

Day 6 deques and sets

Day 7 First Tree problem!  Make a tree of directory contents

Day 8 Ray Tracing!  Use Np and list slicing, learned that you can just use np.rot to rotate axis in stead of coding it all

Day 9 Rope Simulation, modeled movement 1 at a time with both head and tail, track in set. Part 2 just iterate through all ropes trading 1 head for the previous tail etc.  After solve read about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_distance , also pretty cool vis in python https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zgq3nr/2022_day_9_rope_pull/

Day 10 Computer Simulation!  State Machine
